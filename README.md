# XOR_Encryption_Algorithm

1) Made By: Purgatory666
2) Language: Python
3) Date: 16/8/2021

Key Features:

1) Program encryptes messages using XOR algorithm
2) Every letter is encrypted using a different key
3) Easy to understand
4) Easy to use
5) Encrypted value and key used is mentioned in output
6) Fast and efficient

NOTE: 
1) Code is not explained
2) 2) Program is still in development
3) New features will be added very soon
4) If possible try to avoid spaces, it will give an error (In some IDE's it works as the ASCII character of a blank space is 32 )
      
      
Encryption Process:
  1) Converts letter to ASCII
  2) Converts ASCII to binary
  3) Uses random pre-defined key to encrypt (New keys can be added and used for encryption)


General Information:
1) This program cannot be used to decrypt messages
2) A new repository containing the decryption algorithm will be created very soon
3) Feel free to add and modify the code
