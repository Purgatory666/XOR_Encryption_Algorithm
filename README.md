# XOR_Encyption_Algorithm

##### Made By: Purgatory666
##### Language: Python
##### Date: 16/8/2021

Key Features:

1) Program encryptes messages using XOR algorithm
2) Every letter is encrypted using a different key
3) Easy to understand
4) Easy to use
5) Encrypted value and key used is mentioned in output
6) Fast and efficient

NOTE: Code is not explained
      Program is still in development
      New features will be added very soon
      
      
Encryption Process:
  1) Converts letter to ASCII
  2) Converts ASCII to binary
  3) Uses random pre-defined key to encrypt (New keys can be added and used for encryption)


General Information:
1) This program cannot be used to decrypt messages
2) A new repository containing the decryption algorithm will be created very soon
3) Feel free to add and modify the code
